Introduction
The product recommendation system is designed to help users discover new products they may be interested in, and to help make more informed purchasing decisions. The system uses a user's browsing and purchase history to provide personalized recommendations, and the user can indicate if they are a new user or not to help tailor the recommendations.

Installation and Setup
To install and set up the product recommendation system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application by running python app.py.
Usage
The product recommendation system has a simple UI that consists of two buttons: "Yes" and "No". If the user clicks "Yes", they will be taken to a page that shows popular products based on a popularity-based filtering approach. If the user clicks "No", they will be taken to a page that shows products based on a combination of collaborative and content-based filtering.

Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses a user's behavior (such as items they have purchased or rated) to find other users with similar behavior and recommend items to the user based on what those similar users have liked. In this project, we apply collaborative filtering to our dataset to generate recommendations.

Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering is a technique that uses the properties of an item (such as its description or category) to recommend other items with similar properties to the user. In this project, we use the rating column of our dataset to implement content-based filtering.

Future Improvements
There are several areas where the product recommendation system could be improved in the future, including:

Implementing more advanced algorithms for collaborative and content-based filtering.
Integrating with other data sources to improve the quality of recommendations.
Improving the user interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.
