# <b>Introduction</b>

The product recommendation system is designed to help users discover new products they may be interested in, and to help make more informed purchasing decisions. The system uses a user's browsing and purchase history to provide personalized recommendations, and the user can indicate if they are a new user or not to help tailor the recommendations.

# <b>Installation and Setup</b>

To install and set up the product recommendation system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install flask.
Run the application by running python app.py.

# <b>Usage</b>

The product recommendation system has a simple UI that consists of two buttons: "Yes" and "No". If the user clicks "Yes", they will be taken to a page that shows popular products based on a popularity-based filtering approach. If the user clicks "No", they will be taken to a page that shows products based on a combination of collaborative and content-based filtering.

# <b>Collaborative Filtering</b>

Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses a user's behavior (such as items they have purchased or rated) to find other users with similar behavior and recommend items to the user based on what those similar users have liked. In this project, we apply collaborative filtering to our dataset to generate recommendations.

# <b>Content-Based Filtering</b>

Content-based filtering is a technique that uses the properties of an item (such as its description or category) to recommend other items with similar properties to the user. In this project, we use the rating column of our dataset to implement content-based filtering.

# <b>Future Improvements</b>

There are several areas where the product recommendation system could be improved in the future, including:

Implementing more advanced algorithms for collaborative and content-based filtering.
Integrating with other data sources to improve the quality of recommendations.
Improving the user interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.

# Popularity-Based Filtering
Popularity-based filtering is a simple technique that recommends items based on their overall popularity or sales. In this project, we use popularity-based filtering to recommend products to new users who indicate that they are not already registered.

# Evaluation Metric 

In this Project our evaluation metric is measuring How accurate our model is predicting i.e. what products our model is giving or recommending and what should it actually recommend so for this we are using a prediction array which will include the ratings given by a particular user on every product if user has not given any rating then that cell will conatin 0.Then we are calculating values for another array which include values for every product on the basis of prediction what rating user could have given if he/she buys it i.e. simply the difference between given ratings and predicted ratings after applying different filtering models.
